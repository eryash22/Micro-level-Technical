# Micro-level-Technical
### Micro-level Technical â€” Selected (Emami, Tata Motors, Titan, Reliance, Bajaj Finserv) | 2022
I built structured **Excel datasets** to track and understand how big investors position themselves in Indian stocks. Using **NSE in Excel** for real-time market data and **Moneycontrol** for price, delivery, and futures statistics, I consolidated and cleaned raw data to make it analysis-ready.
I studied **3-month cumulative Open Interest (OI)** and **delivery trends** to detect whether institutions were building **long or short positions**. Based on this analysis, I created **swing trade setups** that align with market bias and potential accumulation/distribution phases.
**Key Highlights**
* Automated & consolidated raw market data into clean Excel sheets for deeper stock analysis.
* Mapped **institutional activity** (OI buildup + delivery % trends) to anticipate trend continuation or reversal.
* Selected top mid & large-cap stocks (e.g., **Emami, Tata Motors, Titan, Reliance, Bajaj Finserv**) for focused analysis.
